tetris in javascript

The code was built with assistance from https://medium.com/@michael.karen/learning-modern-javascript-with-tetris-92d532bcd057.

By creating the files composer.json and index.php into the root directory, it enables the code to be hosted on Heroku by "fooling" Heroku into hosting the code as a php application.  I want to understand why this works more thoroughly (no php experience other than this) but my rough understanding based on the code is that a php script essentially mirrors index.html and turns it into an app with a "fake" back-end compatible with Heroku's hosting standards.
